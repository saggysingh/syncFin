Hi Pawan,

As we have discussed image required the blob object while uploading. I was checking the blob object of image in read API that is giving me SYF URL. That means somewhere the images are uploaded on SYF server.

Image URL For Showing the Image on Edit Page:
https://vdlsyficmapda01.cpu.syfbank.com:7002/cs/BlobServer?blobkey=id&blobnocache=true&blobwhere=1429920716840&blobheadername3=MDT-Type&blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&blobheadername1=Content-Type&blobheadervalue3=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&blobheadervalue2=attachment%3B+filename%3D%22social%2B-%2BCopy.jpg%22%3Bfilename*%3DUTF-8%27%27social%2B-%2BCopy.jpg&blobheadervalue1=image%2Fjpeg&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs

Below is the Blob Object that we are getting from Read API:
{"name":"ThumbnailImage","data":{"blobValue":{"filename":"756/772/social - Copy.jpg","foldername":"/appdata/sf/Oracle/Middleware/11.1.1.8/shared/ccurl/","filedata":"","href":"https://vdlsyficmapda01.cpu.syfbank.com:7002/cs/BlobServer?blobkey=id&blobnocache=true&blobwhere=1429920716840&blobheadername3=MDT-Type&blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&blobheadername1=Content-Type&blobheadervalue3=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&blobheadervalue2=attachment%3B+filename%3D%22social%2B-%2BCopy.jpg%22%3Bfilename*%3DUTF-8%27%27social%2B-%2BCopy.jpg&blobheadervalue1=image%2Fjpeg&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs"}}}

Also i was also doing some research how we can create the blob object. As per my research, these should be flow for creating the blob object:

1. We need to upload the files on server. 
2. We need to call the API for directly accessing the Image URL, That API response should be Blob.
3. After getting the Blob object from #2 API, We need to send in POST API.

Please read the below article for understaing:

Can you please have a look and let us know the flow for creating a blob object for image/Video or any assets on SYF server? We may be need some API:

1. File Upload API on OWCS server.

I hope it will help you more.

Please have a look and let me know your thoughts. If you will provide your thoughts that will be really great help from your side.
